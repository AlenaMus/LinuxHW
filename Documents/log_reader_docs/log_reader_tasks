Project Tasks: WSL Log File Reader
This document outlines the development tasks for the read_time.sh script, based on the requirements defined in the PRD.

1. Core Script Development
[ ] Create the file: Create a new bash script file named read_time.sh.

[ ] Set up the loop: Implement a core infinite while loop that runs continuously.

[ ] Read the log: Use the tail -1 command within the loop to read and display only the last line of the time.log file.

[ ] Control frequency: Add a sleep command to pause the loop for 7 seconds between reads.

2. File and Process Management
[ ] Handle file existence: Add logic to gracefully handle cases where the time.log file does not yet exist, preventing the script from crashing.

[ ] Remove internal control: Ensure there is no user-facing input (read) or self-termination logic (trap, cleanup functions) within the script itself.

[ ] Define environment: Place the #!/bin/bash shebang line at the top of the file to specify the interpreter.

3. Testing and Integration
[ ] Verify output: Test the script to confirm that it only prints the last line of the time.log file.

[ ] Grant permissions: Ensure the script has execute permissions (chmod +x read_time.sh) so it can be run as a program.

[ ] Integrate with manager: Verify that the script can be launched and terminated successfully by a parent script like task_manager.sh.
