Product Requirements Document: WSL Time Logger
1. Introduction
This document outlines the product requirements for a simple command-line application designed to run on the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). The application, referred to as the "Time Logger," will serve as a foundational utility for demonstrating and testing basic background processes and inter-process communication within a Linux environment.

2. Goals
Primary Goal: To continuously log the current time to a file at a fixed interval.

Secondary Goal: To be manageable by a separate program, allowing for remote start, stop, and output control.

3. User Stories
As a system administrator, I want to run the time logger in the background so that it can operate without my continuous intervention.

As a developer, I want to be able to stop the time logger gracefully so that it doesn't leave orphaned processes.

As a user, I want a clear indication of where the logged data is being stored.

4. Functional Requirements
Log Generation: The program MUST create or truncate a file named time.log.

Data Logging: The program MUST write the current system time (including the date) to the time.log file every 10 seconds.

Background Operation: The core logging loop MUST run as a background process.

Permissions: The program MUST have the necessary permissions to create and write to the log file.

Process Management: The program MUST be able to be started and stopped by an external script or parent process, without requiring direct user input.

5. Technical Requirements
Language: Bash scripting.

Environment: Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

Dependencies: Standard Linux utilities such as date, echo, sleep, touch, chmod, kill, tail, and grep. No external installations should be required.

Error Handling: The script should gracefully handle the termination of its background process and should suppress error messages when killing a process that may have already been stopped (2>/dev/null).

6. Future Considerations
Reader Module: A separate, companion script will be developed to read the last line from the time.log file at a specified interval (e.g., every 7 seconds) and display the output. This module will also be designed for remote execution and control.

Combined Manager: A master script (task_manager.sh) will be created to orchestrate both the logger and reader programs. This manager will be responsible for starting both processes and providing a single, clean interface for the user to stop them.
