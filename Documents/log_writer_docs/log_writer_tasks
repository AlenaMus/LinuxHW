Project Tasks: WSL Time Logger
This document outlines the development tasks required to build the WSL Time Logger and its companion scripts, based on the requirements defined in the PRD.

1. Logger Module (log_time.sh)
Core Functionality

[ ] Create a new bash script file named log_time.sh.

[ ] Implement a core infinite while loop to run in the background.

[ ] Inside the loop, add a command to write the current time to time.log.

[ ] Add a sleep command to pause the loop for 10 seconds.

File Management

[ ] Add logic to create or truncate the time.log file at the start of the script.

[ ] Implement logic to ensure the script has write permissions to time.log.

Integration

[ ] Remove all user-facing prompts and self-termination logic (read, trap, cleanup functions).

2. Reader Module (read_time.sh)
Core Functionality

[ ] Create a new bash script file named read_time.sh.

[ ] Implement a core infinite while loop.

[ ] Inside the loop, add a tail -1 command to read only the last line of time.log.

[ ] Add a sleep command to pause the loop for 7 seconds.

Integration

[ ] Remove all user-facing prompts and self-termination logic (read, trap, cleanup functions).

3. Combined Manager (task_manager.sh)
Core Functionality

[ ] Create a new bash script file named task_manager.sh.

[ ] Implement a cleanup function to gracefully kill background processes.

[ ] Use trap to ensure the cleanup function is called on script exit.

Process Management

[ ] Launch log_time.sh as a background process.

[ ] Store the Process ID (PID) of log_time.sh.

[ ] Launch read_time.sh as a background process, ensuring its output is visible in the terminal.

[ ] Store the Process ID (PID) of read_time.sh.

User Control

[ ] Implement a while loop that continuously checks for a specific keypress (e.g., 'q').

[ ] Add a conditional statement to break the loop when the designated key is pressed.

4. General Tasks
[ ] Add the #!/bin/bash shebang line to the top of all three scripts.

[ ] Ensure all three script files have Unix-style line endings (LF).

[ ] Grant execute permissions to all three files (chmod +x).

[ ] Run the task_manager.sh script to test the complete system.
